# Customers & Products Analysis Project Using SQL
This project aims to utilize SQL to retrieve data from a database to facilitate decision-making by doing a comprehensive data analysis. The database stores data on sales records for scale model cars.


## Getting Started 
1. For this project I would encourage you to type and run queries on your own machine, as you would working as a data professional. To do this, you need to prepare your computer for the project by installing the necessary tools.
   I'll be using a SQLite database, and you will need a tool on your computer to query and manipulate this database. [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) is a commonly used tool to handle SQLite databases. You can find the database file for this project [here](https://github.com/Clifton-Lee/Customers-Products-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/stores.db).
